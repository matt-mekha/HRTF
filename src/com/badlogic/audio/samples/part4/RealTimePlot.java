/**
 * A simple example on how to do real-time plotting. First all samples
 * from an mp3 file are read in and plotted, 1024 samples per pixel. Next
 * we open a new MP3Decoder and an AudioDevice and play back the music. While
 * doing this we also set a marker in the plot that shows us the current position
 * of the music playback. The marker position is calculated in pixels by
 * measuring the elapsed time between the start of the playback and the 
 * current time. The elapsed time is then multiplied by the frequency divided
 * by the sample window size (1024 samples in this case). This gives us the
 * x-coordinate of the marker in the plot. After writting a sample window
 * to the audio device and setting the marker we sleep for 20ms to give
 * the Swing GUI thread time to repaint the plot with the updated marker
 * position.
